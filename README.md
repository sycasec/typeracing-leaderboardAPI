# CSG Type Racing Backend API
- literal API just to store CSG leaderboard
- totally unecessary

## i did an oopsie
- i exposed a password on the previous database
- this was not intentional
    - fixing it would take way too many steps rather than just nuking the repo.
    - this is why you dont just spam commit -> push!
    - will work on docker soon
